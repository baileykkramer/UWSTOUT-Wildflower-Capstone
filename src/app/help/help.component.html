                Identification begins with answering five standard questions about 
                your specimen. Your answers determine the plant group to which it 
                belongs. You then refer to this plant group in the Locator Key, 
                which in turn sends you to the page in the text where your plant 
                and others similar to it are described. You complete your 
                identification by matching your specimen to the pertinent 
                description and, as a double-check, to the illustration on the 
                facing page. A unique feature of the text is that the first 
                sentence of each description distinguishes that plant from all 
                others in the group.

                            the arrangement and number of the petals or similar flower parts. 
                            The second is by Plant Type – wildflower, shrub or vine – and, if the 
                            plant is a wildflower, by the arrangement of its leaves. The third is 
                            by Leaf Type. The combination of these three classifications determine 
                            the <em>plant group</em> to which your specimen belongs. The three

Similarly, your answers to the third and fourth questions will send you to the appropriate section under Plant type, and your answer to the fifth question will refer you to the proper section under Leaf Type.
                            You now utilize the three section numbers as a 3-digit group number. For instance, if your flower is irregular (section 1 under Flower Type), and is a wildflower with alternate leaves (section 3 under Plant Type), and has toothed leaves (section 3 under Leaf Type), your group number is 133. Another example: roses will be found in plant group 554 because they have five regular petals (5--), and are shrubs (5--) with divided leaves (554).</p>
