<h1>The Key System and How It Works</h1>

<p>  
    Identification begins with answering five standard questions about your specimen. Your answers determine the plant group to which it belongs. You then refer to this plant group in the Locator Key, which in turn sends you to the page in the text where your plant and others similar to it are described. You complete your identification by matching your specimen to the pertinent description and, as a double-check, to the illustration on the facing page. A unique feature of the text is that the first sentence of each description distinguishes that plant from all others in the group.

    <h2> Five Questions </h2>

    <h3> Flower Type </h3>
        <p>
            •	Is the flower regular (radially symmetrical or irregular, or are the flower parts indistinguishable?
            •	If regular, how many petals or similar parts does it have?
        </p>

<h3> Plant Type </h3>
        <p> •	Is the plant a wildflower or a shrub or a vine?</p>
        <p>•	If a wildflower, is it without leaves, or if it has leaves, are they all at the base of the plant, or are they arranged singly on the stem (alternate), or are they opposite one another in pairs or whorls? </p>
   
    <h3> Leaf Type </h3>
        <p> •	Are the leaves entire (with even and unbroken margins), or are they toothed or lobed or divided? </p>
        <p> If you are a beginner, you no doubt will need further explanation before you are able to answer all the questions. (Turn to page…), where the basic terms are explained and illustrated simply and nontechnically. Even if you are experienced at identification, you should review the basic terms to learn their specific definitions in this (book). </p>
