<p>  
    Identification begins with answering five standard questions about 
    your specimen. Your answers determine the plant group to which it 
    belongs. You then refer to this plant group in the Locator Key, 
    which in turn sends you to the page in the text where your plant 
    and others similar to it are described. You complete your 
    identification by matching your specimen to the pertinent 
    description and, as a double-check, to the illustration on the 
    facing page. A unique feature of the text is that the first 
    sentence of each description distinguishes that plant from all 
    others in the group.

    <h3> Five Questions </h3>

    <h4> Flower Type </h4>
        <ul>
            <li> Is the flower regular (radially symmetrical or irregular, 
                 or are the flower parts indistinguishable?</li>
            <li>If regular, how many petals or similar parts does it have?</li>
        </ul>

<h4> Plant Type </h4>
<<<<<<< HEAD
        <p> •	Is the plant a wildflower or a shrub or a vine?</p>
        <p>•	If a wildflower, is it without leaves, or if it has leaves, are they all at the base of the plant, or are they arranged singly on the stem (alternate), or are they opposite one another in pairs or whorls? </p>
   
    <h4> Leaf Type </h4>
        <p> •	Are the leaves entire (with even and unbroken margins), or are they toothed or lobed or divided? </p>
        <p> If you are a beginner, you no doubt will need further explanation before you are able to answer all the questions. (Turn to page…), where the basic terms are explained and illustrated simply and nontechnically. Even if you are experienced at identification, you should review the basic terms to learn their specific definitions in this (book). </p>

            are they toothed or lobed or divided? </p>

        where the basic terms are explained and illustrated simply and

<h3>Determining The Plant Group And The Group Number</h3>

    <p>Each plant is classified in three ways. The first is by Flower Type: 
        the arrangement and number of the petals or similar flower parts. 
        The second is by Plant Type – wildflower, shrub or vine – and, if the 
        plant is a wildflower, by the arrangement of its leaves. The third is 
        by Leaf Type. The combination of these three classifications determine 
        the plant <i>group</i> to which your specimen belongs. The three 
        classifications are as follows: </p>
    
        <p><i>Flower Type</i></p>
        <ol type="1">
            <li>Irregular Flowers</li>
            <li>Flowers with 2 Regular Parts</li>
            <li>Flowers with 3 Regular Parts</li>
            <li>Flowers with 4 Regular Parts</li>
            <li>Flowers with 5 Regular Parts</li>
            <li>Flowers with 6 Regular Parts</li>
            <li>Flowers with 7 or more Regular Parts</li>
            <li>Flower Parts Indistinguishable</li>
        </ol>
        <p></p>
        <p><i>Plant Type</i></p>
        <ol type="1">
        
        <li>Wildflowers with No Apparent Leaves</li>
        <li>Wildflowers with Basal Leaves Only</li>
        <li>Wildflowers with Alternate Leaves</li>
        <li>Wildflowers with Opposite or Whirled Leaves</li>
        <li>Shrubs</li>
        <li>Vines</li>
        </ol>
        
        <p><i>Leaf Type</i></p>
        <ol type = "1">
            <li>No Apparent Leaves</li>
            <li>Leaves Entire</li>
            <li>Leaves Toothed or Lobed</li>
            <li>Leaves Divided</li>
        </ol>
        
        Your answers to the first two of the Five Questions enable you to assign your specimen to one of the sections under Flower Type. Similarly, your answers to the third and fourth questions will send you to the appropriate section under Plant type, and your answer to the fifth question will refer you to the proper section under Leaf Type.
            You now utilize the three section numbers as a 3-digit group number. For instance, if your flower is irregular (section 1 under Flower Type), and is a wildflower with alternate leaves (section 3 under Plant Type), and has toothed leaves (section 3 under Leaf Type), your group number is 133. Another example: roses will be found in plant group 554 because they have five regular petals (5--), and are shrubs (5--) with divided leaves (554).
        
        Using the Locator Key
        
            Next, you find your group number in the Locator Key, which begins after you select your group code. There your search is narrowed further, and you are sent to a page where your plant and those similar to it are described and illustrated. You then identify your specimen either by comparing it with the illustration**** and confirming your identification with the description, or vice versa. Remember the first sentence of each description distinguishes the plat from all others in its group.
        
        EXAMPLE THINGA MAGIG
        
        Goldenrods And Asters: A Special Note
        These two large genera of familiar fall wildflowers have been placed in a separate section at the end of the text, to avoid having to split them up among many plant groups. This special treatment does not affect the workings of the key system, but it does provide a shortcut. If you recognize, at the outset, that your specimen belongs to either of these genera, you can immediately refer to them by clicking on their respective buttons on the classification (home) page and follow it to the page on which your specimen is described.
