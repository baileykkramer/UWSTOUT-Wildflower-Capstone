                <p class="text-justify"><em>Regular flowers</em> are radially symmetrical, which means that their petals or petal-like parts (or rays in flowers like the Daisy) are arranged around the center like the spokes of a wheel.Each petal or petal-like part is similar in size, shape and color to all the others. If the petals or parts are united, as in bell-shaped flowers like the Lily-of-the-valley, then the lobes of the flowers are likewise similar in size, shape and color. The majority of flowers are regular.Examples are Lilies, Roses, Buttercups and Asters.</p>
                <div class="alert alert-warning"><strong>Caution:</strong> Some flowers grow closely grouped together in a spike or head; the familiar clover head is an example. In counting the flower parts or determining whether the flower and examine that.</div>

                <p class="text-justify"><em>Irregular flowers</em> are not radially symmetrical; that is, their petals or petal-like parts are not similar in size, shape or color. Usually, these flowers have upper and lower parts that are called <em>lips</em>. Familiar irregular flowers are Violets, Orchids and Peas.</p>
                <p class="text-justify"><em>Indistinguishable</em> flowers either have no visible petal-like parts or the parts are so small that it is difficult to amke out their number or arrangement.</p>
                <div class="alert alert-warning"><strong>Caution:</strong> A flower may be very small and still have parts that are quite discernible. If you cannot find your specimen after assigning it to the Indistinguishable section, you will need to reexamine it, preferably with a small magnifying glass (5- or 10-power), to make sure that it is, in fact, indistinguishable.</div>

            <div class="panel-body">
              <p class="text-justify">For the purpose of this application, a <em>wildflower</em> is any flowering plant that grows in a natural state and is not a tree, a shrub or a vine as defined below.</p>
              <p class="text-justify">A <em>tree</em> is a woody plant, generally ewith a single main stem that is permanently above the ground. At maturity it is over ten feet high</p>
              <p class="text-justify">A <em>shrub</em> is also a plant with a woody stem permanently above the ground, but at maturity it is usually under ten feet high. Characteristically, shrubs are bushy and extensively branched, but so are a few wildflowers, so the real point of distinction is the toughness and woodiness of the shrubs' main stems.</p>
              <p class="text-justify">Certain plants, among them Wintergreen and Trailing Arbutus, are technically shrubs because they have woody stems, but since the lay man would not recognize them as shrubs, they have been included among the wildflowers.</p>
              <p class="text-justify">A <em>vine</em> is a plant with long trailing, twining or climbing stems generally over two feet long. Trailing or creeping plants with shorter stems, such as Partidgeberry and Myrtle, will be foudn among the wildflowers.</p>
              <p class="text-justify">Some shrubs are also vines; that is, their woody stems trail or climb or twine. They will be found in the vines section.</p>

            <div class="panel-body">
                <p>INSERT IMAGE</p>
                <p class="text-justify">Leaves growing from the base of the plant are <em>basal leaves</em>; those growing above the base are <em>stem leaves</em>; many plants have both. When the stem leaves grow directly across from each other, in pairs, the leaves are called <em>opposite</em>; when they grow in circles of threes, fours, fives, and so on, they are termed <em>whorled</em>. If, on the other hand, the leaves are arranged singly on the stem, first at one point and then at another, they are <em>alternate</em>.</p>
                <p class="text-justify">When the detemining whether leaves are opposite or alternate, avoid if possible the tips of the stem where the leaves are crowded together. Instead, select a part of the main stem where the leaves are widely spaced and their arrangement is distinct. If there is only one stem leaf, it is considered alternate.</p>

              <div class="panel-heading"><h4>TYPES OF LEAVES: ENTIRE, TOOTHED, LOBED AND DIVIDED</h4></div>
              <div class="panel-body">
                <p class="text-justify">If the margin of a leaf is even and unbroken, the leaf is said to be <em>entire</em>.</p>
                <p class="text-justify">If the margin has more or less regular, shallow indentations, the leaf is <em>toothed</em>. Included are leaves with wavy and scalloped edges as well as those with pointed teeth.</p>
                <p class="text-justify">The leaves of some plants have one or more deeper indentations, which separate the leaf into several sections known as <em>lobes</em>, as in the familiar oak leaf and maple leaf.</p>
                <div class="alert alert-warning"><strong>EXCEPTION:</strong> by convention, leaves that are lobed only at the base, such as heart-shaped and arrow-shaped leaves, are considered entire or toothed depending upon their margins.</div>
                <p class="text-justify">Often a leaf is actually <em>divided</em> into separate parts known as leaflets. The clover leaf, for example, is composed of three leaflets. For the purposes of this guide, if some of the leaf indentations go <em>almost</em> to the midrib, even though the divisions are not strictly leaflets, the leaf is considered to be divided. In borderline cases they will appear both ways in the Locator Key: under <em>lobed</em> and under <em>divided</em>.</p>
                <p class="text-justify">Beginners sometimes misteake a divided leaf for a branch. The leaflets of a divided leaf all lie in teh same plane, so that the whole leaf forms a flat surface; also, all the leaves look alike. Branches of the same plant, on the other hand, vary greatly in size and appearance; the leaves normally face in different directions and will therefore not lie flat. Branches also bear flower and leaf buds, which leaves never do.</p>
                <p class="text-justify">Always select the largest or best-developed leaves, usually the lower leaves of the plant, when determining the leaf type. If two types of leaves are present, those with the deepest indentations determine the category in which it should be placed. For instance, if some of the leaves are lobed and others divided, the plant should be classified as having divided leaves.</p>
                <p class="text-justify">The various shapes of leaves are illustrated and identified below.</p>

      <div class="panel-body">
        <p class="text-justify">The plant's reproductive organs occupy the center of the normal flower. The female part consists of one or more <em>pistils</em>, each containing an <em>ovary</em>, which after fertilization expands and forms the fruit. The top of a pistil may have one or more projections called <em>styles</em>, each bearing a <em>stigma</em> at the end. The male organs are the <em>stamens</em> and are made up of two parts --- the <em>filament</em> or stalk, and the <em>anther</em> or pollen-bearing tip. Some species have flowers that are <em>unisexual</em>, that is, they have either stamens (<em>staminate flowers</em>) or pistils (<em>pistillate flowers</em>) but not both together in the same flower. Both types of unisexual flowers can be on the same plant or they can be on separate plants.</p>
        <p class="text-justify">INSERT IMAGE</p>
        <p class="text-justify">Surrounding the reproductive organs in most flowers, there are two sets of floral parts. The upper set is the <span class="font-italic">petals</span>, which may be of any color; the lower set is teh <em>sepals</em>, which are usually green. However, if only one set is present they are considered to be sepals, even though they are brightly colored, as in the Marsh Marigold. The petals collectively are called the <em>corolla</em>. If the petals are joined together at the base, as in the Harebell, they are then more properly called <em>corolla lobes</em>. Similarly, all of the sepals comprise the <em>calyx</em>, and if they are joined at the base, they are known as <em>calyx lobes</em>.</p>
        <p class="text-justify">Flowers grow in several different arrangements --- heads, spikes, umbels, and the like. These are illustrated below.</p>
