                    <p>If the margin of a leaf is even and unbroken, the leaf is said to be <span title="With the margin unbroken by teeth, lobs or divisions">entire</span>.</p>
                    <p>If the margin has more or less <span title="Having all the parts alike in size and shape">regular</span>, shallow indentations, the leaf is <span title="Having several to many small indentations along the margin">toothed</span>. Included are leaves with wavy and scalloped edges as well as those with pointed teeth.</p>
                    <p>The leaves of some plants have one or more deeper indentations, which separate the leaf into several sections known as <span title="One of the segments, usually rounded, of a leaf or flower">lobes</span>, as in the familiar oak leaf and maple leaf.</p>
                    <div class="alert alert-warning"><strong>EXCEPTION:</strong> by convention, leaves that are <span title="One of the segments, usually rounded, of a leaf or flower">lobed</span> only at the base, such as heart-shaped and arrow-shaped leaves, are considered <span title="With the margin unbroken by teeth, lobs or divisions">entire</span> or <span title="Having several to many small indentations along the margin">toothed</span> depending upon their margins.</div>
                    <p>Often a leaf is actually <span title="Cleft to, or almost to, the base or the midrib. A 2- to 3-times-divided leaf has each of its segments divided again and sometimes again">divided</span> into separate parts known as <span title="One of the separate and similar parts of a divided leaf">leaflets</span>. The clover leaf, for example, is composed of three <span title="One of the separate and similar parts of a divided leaf">leaflets</span>. For the purposes of this guide, if some of the leaf indentations go almost to the <span title="The central vein of a leaf or leaflet">midrib</span>, even though the divisions are not strictly <span title="One of the separate and similar parts of a divided leaf">leaflets</span>, the leaf is considered to be <span title="Cleft to, or almost to, the base or the midrib. A 2- to 3-times-divided leaf has each of its segments divided again and sometimes again">divided</span>. In borderline cases they will appear both ways in the Locator Key: under <span title="One of the segments, usually rounded, of a leaf or flower">lobed</span> and under <span title="Cleft to, or almost to, the base or the midrib. A 2- to 3-times-divided leaf has each of its segments divided again and sometimes again">divided</span>.</p>
                    <p>Beginners sometimes mistake a divided leaf for a branch. The <span title="One of the separate and similar parts of a divided leaf">leaflets</span> of a <span title="Cleft to, or almost to, the base or the midrib. A 2- to 3-times-divided leaf has each of its segments divided again and sometimes again">divided</span> leaf all lie in the same plane, so that the whole leaf forms a flat surface; also, all the leaves look alike. Branches of the same plant, on the other hand, vary greatly in size and appearance; the leaves normally face in different directions and will therefore not lie flat. Branches also bear flower and leaf buds, which leaves never do.</p>
                    <p>Always select the largest or best-developed leaves, usually the lower leaves of the plant, when determining the leaf type. If two types of leaves are present, those with the deepest indentations determine the category in which it should be placed. For instance, if some of the leaves are <span title="One of the segments, usually rounded, of a leaf or flower">lobed</span> and others <span title="Cleft to, or almost to, the base or the midrib. A 2- to 3-times-divided leaf has each of its segments divided again and sometimes again">divided</span>, the plant should be classified as having <span title="Cleft to, or almost to, the base or the midrib. A 2- to 3-times-divided leaf has each of its segments divided again and sometimes again">divided</span> leaves.</p>

      <div class="panel-body text-justify">
        <p>The plant's reproductive organs occupy the center of the normal flower. The female part consists of one or more <span title="The central female reproductive part of a flower">pistils</span>, each containing an <span title="The enlarged base of the pistil that produces the seeds">ovary</span>, which after fertilization expands and forms the fruit. The top of a <span title="The central female reproductive part of a flower">pistil</span> may have one or more projections called <span title="The stalk of the pistil, connecting the ovary and the stigma">styles</span>, each bearing a <span title="The pollen-receiving tip of the pistil">stigma</span> at the end. The male organs are the <span title="The male organ of a flower, consisting of a slender stalk and a knoblike, pollen-bearing tip">stamens</span> and are made up of two parts --- the <span title="The anther-bearing stalk of a stamen">filament</span> or <span title="The stem or leaf of a flower">stalk</span>, and the <span title="The pollen-bearing part of the stamen">anther</span> or pollen-bearing tip. Some species have flowers that are unisexual, that is, they have either <span title="The male organ of a flower, consisting of a slender stalk and a knoblike, pollen-bearing tip">stamens</span> (staminate flowers) or <span title="The central female reproductive part of a flower">pistils</span> (pistillate flowers) but not both together in the same flower. Both types of unisexual flowers can be on the same plant or they can be on separate plants.</p>
        <img class="img-responsive center-block" src="assets/img/flower_diagram.jpg" alt="parts of flower">
        <p>Surrounding the reproductive organs in most flowers, there are two sets of floral parts. The upper set is the <span title="One of the segments of the corolla">petals</span>, which may be of any color; the lower set is the <span title="One of the segments of the calyx">sepals</span>, which are usually green. However, if only one set is present they are considered to be <span title="One of the segments of the calyx">sepals</span>, even though they are brightly colored, as in the Marsh Marigold. The <span title="One of the segments of the corolla">petals</span> collectively are called the <span title="The inner circle of flower parts, made up of petals">corolla</span>. If the <span title="One of the segments of the corolla">petals</span> are joined together at the base, as in the Harebell, they are then more properly called <span title="The inner circle of flower parts, made up of petals">corolla lobes</span>. Similarly, all of the <span title="One of the segments of the calyx">sepals</span> comprise the <span title="The outer circle of flower parts, made up of sepals">calyx</span>, and if they are joined at the base, they are known as <span title="The outer circle of flower parts, made up of sepals">calyx lobes</span>.</p>
        <p>Flowers grow in several different arrangements --- <span title="A group of flowers joined together in a short, dense, terminal cluster, as in the clovers and in all members of the Composite Family">heads</span>, <span title="An elongated flower cluster with stalkless flowers arranged along a central stem">spikes</span>, <span title="A flower cluster in which all the flower stalks radiate from the same point, like the ribs of an umbrella">umbels</span>, and the like. These are illustrated below.</p>
